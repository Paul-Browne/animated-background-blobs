# Animated Background Blobs

This is an attempt to kinda recreate the [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) homepage background animation of morphing blobs (but without the 40kb of js and WebGl) This whole script is under 2kb, with a whole bunch of options. Check out the [Demo/Docs](https://paul-browne.github.io/animated-background-blobs) page or have a play around in the [Sandbox](https://paul-browne.github.io/animated-background-blobs/sandbox.html)
